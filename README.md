# Transformer-own-files
Here i share my own files of this Transformer Build 
this files i use in my transformer of Michael rechtin, this repository include bom list, pinmapping, gerber file for my own PCB, everything is free to share

the file sideplate 4mm is to use if somebody not like to do the sideplates in carbon, this is a file to print in pla with 16 inside and outside walls, and 100%Filling.
i Print it stand up and diagonal on the printbed, so there is enough space to handle it. 

the file called stabrolle is a 3mm pin you can use as bearing for the 4 wheels if i remember right you need 15 or 16 pieces for one bearing. so you can print 60 pieces to get all for the wheel bearing, saves wheight otherwise you can use steel rods. 

my boom will be updatet with the screws in future
the pinmapping you can also use at nicholas rehm drehmflight vtol at github.
