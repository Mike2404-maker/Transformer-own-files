# Transformer-own-files
Here i share my own files of this Transformer Build 
this files i use in my transformer of Michael rechtin, this repository include bom list, pinmapping, gerber file for my own PCB, everything is free to share


Sideplates you have to do in Carbon plate 1.5mm or 2mm depends on you. i try in pla but its much to heavy

the file called stabrolle is a 3mm pin you can use as bearing for the 4 wheels if i remember right you need 15 or 16 pieces for one bearing. so you can print 60 pieces to get all for the wheel bearing, saves wheight otherwise you can use steel rods. 

my boom will be updatet with the screws in future
the pinmapping you can also use at nicholas rehm drehmflight vtol at github. 

the gerber file you can use over JLC PCB to get your own pcb to wire all of this transformer. ( but its in a testing period.) check file before you order. Everything you do with this files on this repository is at your own risk.
